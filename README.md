# Predictive-Analysis-of-Real-or-Fake-Jobs:
The employment related frauds are becoming more prevalent. This has been a major issue where the merit-based positions are allotted to the employees who fake their credentials. Through this project, a classifier model was developed to detect the fake jobs. After performing the EDA and running the ML model, it was confirmed that the Random Forest Classifier with an F1 score of 92%, to be the best performing model. The basic idea of this model is to deploy it into the job portals for real time testing and to remove fake postings. This project not only showcases my expertise in data analysis and machine learning, but it also reflects my commitment to resolving important employment concerns. I can't wait to put these skills to use and support continued efforts to preserve the integrity of the workforce.
